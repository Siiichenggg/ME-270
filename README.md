# ME-270
This repository contains the design and documentation for our ME270 project: **Shelter**, a multi-modular, portable, and foldable chair. Shelter is designed to function not only as a chair but also as a walking cane. When in its seated configuration, it provides an integrated umbrella support at the top. Furthermore, Shelter is modular, allowing for the attachment of various accessories such as a cup holder, hooks, and other custom modules.
